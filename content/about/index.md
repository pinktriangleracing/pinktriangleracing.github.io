Want to know what the team's about and how it came about, well have  a read here.

## Foundings
Throughout the Covid19 pandemic, founder, Adrian Schmieder, had been working hard and, like many, had saved up some cash.  Having built a manufacturing facility, put in many voluntary hours with his local Blood Bikes Group [(FreeWheelervs EVS)](https://freewheelers.org.uk/) and trying to support the local community through the tough times, he decided he needed to get out and do some motorsport for himself and hopefully get some friends involved.  Thanks go out to the guys behind [44 Teeth](https://www.44teeth.com/) and their [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@FortyFourTeeth) of the early FreeTech races, this seemed like exactly what was in order.  A few months later, a KTM RC125 was purcahsed and the team was born.


## Why small capacity endurance racing?

There are a few reasonable barriers to people particiapting in motorbike racing.  Notably:
- the costs involved
- the risk of injury
- the effort of getting bikes prepared and ready

Small capacity endurance racing seems to cover-off a lot of these concerns:

### Reduced costs
As the team is pursuing small capacity racing, all the costs tend to be a massively reduced.  
- Tyres last a lot longer as they quite easily handle to power of the smaller capacity bikes.
- The fuel cost is reduced as the bikes simply use less of it.
- The bikes to start with are less expensive.
- Ready supply of cheap repair parts reduces the maintenance costs of a race team
- Endurance racing involes a team, and hence some of the fixed costs can be spread more easily between a number of riders, hence each rider's cost is minimised.

### Injury
Small capcaity bikes are slower.  If / when a rider falls off, the chance of major injury is massively reduced.  Top speeds on a 125cc are around 70mph.  Compare this to the +140mph of larger capcity racing and it's easy to see the risk of major injury is massively reduced.

### Endurace Racing
One of the pricipal aims of the race team is to build a community and commaraderie.  As the endurance race needs, at an absolute minimum, 2 riders, it's a great vehicle to building and maintaining friendships within the biking community.  On top of this, the more-than 2hrs of race-time that each rider gets during an 8 hour endurance race, there are few ways to increase the seat time opportunity, especially at the price point.

## Ethos
Having been a long-term member of [OutdoorLads](https://www.outdoorlads.com/), Adrian has seen the massive benefit of having inclusive activities.  Providing a safe and welcoming space for riders of all backgrounds is a key aim of the team.
