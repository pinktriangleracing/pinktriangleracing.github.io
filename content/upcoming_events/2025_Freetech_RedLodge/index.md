Pink Triangle Racing is building a team to enter the upcoming Freetech 10hr endurance race at [Red Lodge Karting](https://www.redlodgekarting.com/).  This will be a tight technical endeavour, and as the first time the team will have raced at Red Lodge, it'll be a big learning curve throughout the weekend.  Riding into the dusk, needing headlights, is an experience not to be missed.
