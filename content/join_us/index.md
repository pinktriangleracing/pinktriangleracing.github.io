As the team is a group of ameatur riders who are keen to get some track time, we're mainly going out to have a good time.  If we do well, that's amazing, but the main aim for the events is to get out on track and have a good time.  This leads to looking forward to welcoming everyone and anyone that's keen to get involved to an event for some fun.  

If you're new to track riding, or have competed in many races, you're welcome to join the team.  The only slight stipulation is that a rider will need to be within 120% of the fastest riders during a race.  Being slower than this can become dangerous, and race organisers retain the right to remove riders from the race if they're riding too slowly.  Apart from that, everyone's welcome and to this end, the team tries to make it as easy as possible for riders to join.  

So, to join the fun, essentially all a rider needs to do is, turn up at the track and bring their rider kit and an attitude to have a great time with some like-minded people.

- Leather 1 piece suit or jacket and trousers that zip together around the whole waistline.

## Non-riding kit:
Some simple bits of non-riding kit are optional but worth brining along.  Perhaps a camping chair,
