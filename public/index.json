[{"content":" Event Details Date Friday/Saturday 12th/13th April 2024 Venue Teesside Karting Championship Freetech Endurance Results: 168 PTR Sprints Calogero - 3rd in clsass 109 JPR Sprints Adrian - 4th in class 168 PTR Endurance 34th overall 109 JPR Endurance 49th overall So, the first outing of the season, and the first time running two KTMs alongside each other. What’s the end result? A good time had by all, even if it’s resulted in a precautionary trip to A\u0026amp;E for one rider ☹.\nFriday test day #Test day on Friday went really well, and we made progress throughout the day, getting riders used to a new bike, race shift, a quick shifter and the track itself. Also making adjustments to sprockets to try and tune the final drive ratio.\nSaturday sprint races #Race day, and we had the two bikes out in the Freetech Sprint races; Calogero Lauricella out on 168 Pink Triangle Racing with Adrian Schmieder out on 109 JP Racing.\nResults came in as:\nHeat 1 -\u0026gt; Calogero 1st in class, Adrian 4th in class Heat 2 -\u0026gt; Calogero 3rd in class, Adrian 4th in class Final -\u0026gt; Calogero 3rd in class, Adrian 4th in class Both with respectable fastest laps of around 1:24.\nSaturday endurance race #Onto the endurance race and Tommy Byatt, having squeezed a 1:23.4, had qualified Pink Triangle Racing into 15th overall, with Christian James having put 109 JP Racing at 26th with a 1:25.8 lap. Both decent efforts and putting us in good standing, though it was a shame not to make the most of this with the Le Mans start being abandoned.\n109 JP Racing #Race start and unfortunately on the 2nd complete lap, Christian came off worst from a bust up into the hairpins after the long right-hander. Bike 109 down in the middle of the track, front fairing off, a bit of recovery back to the paddock and check over from Tom Geerah, our resident paramedic, and that’s Christian\u0026rsquo;s race done for. Thankfully, repairs to the bike were shorter than those Christian may have to endure (sorry man), and we were able to get the bike back on the track and plodding around, but now basically dead last.\nHenry and Tom took turns keeping the bike upright and going round until Tommy took the last stint at the end of the race, which had taken our new Rider Manager Dan Grilo by surprise for being extended by some additional time. Tommy did a great final stint, setting the team’s fastest lap at 1:21.3, and brought the team back in at a respectable 49th overall, especially considering a 33min lap at the start while getting the bike back on track.\n168 Pink Triangle Racing #Meanwhile, 168 Pink Triangle Racing had started with Tommy setting strong times of low 1min22s with Lee and Adrian in and around 1min28s bringing the team briefly to 11th overall but dropping a little to around 23rd until Tommy had the ignition momentarily cut out whilst banked over on the long right hander leading to him sliding out; thankfully just missing taking out Tom on the 109 bike; whom he’d just undertaken. A bit of a dust-down of the bike back in the paddock, a review and nothing seen to be wrong, and Tommy was out again, though with his confidence in the bike a little knocked and the team now running in 40th. From here the team continued well and was able to recover back up to 34th by the end of the race.\nSo a few photos in parc fermé, a pack-up in the paddock and then the long drive home. A great time had by all, some riders back to the championship after a bit of time away, some new riders introduced to the fun of Freetech Endurance, and some bike repairs to keep the manager busy before the next race at Whilton Mill where it’ll be super exciting to try out their new corner!!!\nUntil next time all and keep it shiny side up!\n","date":null,"permalink":"/race_reports/2024/freetech_teesside_rnd1/","section":"Race Reports","summary":"","title":"FreeTech Round 1 - Teesside"},{"content":"Pink Triangle Racing will be entering a bike at the MERS 6hr race at Pembrey on August 9th 2025.

We started with the ratio we\u0026rsquo;d finished with earlier in the season at Round 1\u0026hellip; Something must have changed as we ended up with a significantly longer ratio and that seemed to serve us well for the rest of the weekend. General feeling from the day was that things were going smoothly with Tommy putting in low 1:21s laps and Adrian getting fairly solid 1:25s. Saturday morning and Jake Forster joined the team for the first time. Having race #teessidekarting quite a few times on pit bikes, this was his first outing with Freetech Endurance Streetstock Production Moto4. Great to have him get out and familiarise himself with the track and bike in the first practise session, and straight away posting 1:24s and 1:25s, it was clear he could ride a bike.\nSaturday Sprint Races #Tommy was flying throughout the sprint races. Qualifying put him in pole position for heat 1, which he finished in 2nd position. For Heat 2, we\u0026rsquo;d made a change to disengage a misbehaving quick shifter. Unfortunately, without any possible practise, the way we\u0026rsquo;d disconnected the quick shifter seemed to also affect the piggy-back ECU and the engine was misfiring\u0026hellip; This meant Tommy had little power down the straights and he dropped to finish 5th; not great\u0026hellip; he had lots to do in the final race to end on the podium\u0026hellip; which is exactly what he did. A stunning ride and a thriller to the last lap when Tommy came home, not only 1st in class, but first overall winning the Freetech Sprints outright!!! What a ride!! Well done sir!!\nTeam Endurance Race #In between the sprint races, Jake (being the next fastest rider) was sent out in Qually 1 to see if he could get the team into the 2nd qualifying session. Posting a 1:22.04 placed the team 15th and crucially into Qually 2!! From here it was decided that Adrian would run Qually 2 session. Perhaps the fastest time wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible, but as the team was into the 2nd qually session, the lowest we\u0026rsquo;d position would be 17th, and some warm-up track time before the race was deemed worthwhile.\nAdrian brought it home with a 1:24.02 lap putting the team 16th in Qually 2 session. We’re not totally sure what happened with the qualification times, but we ended up lining up 17th on the start line. Pretty happy with that, and with respectable times and consistency possible, it looked promising.\nSo, with Adrian starting for the 1st stint, the race was underway. Not the most competitive start as the team dropped from 17th to 24th, but with Tommy, Jake and Adrian setting consistent 1:20s, 1:23s and 1:25s respectively, the team was climbing back up through the field well; getting to 12th overall by lap 151.\nUnfortunately, and some learning to be had for future races, though the bike’s got an extended fuel tank, it wasn’t clear when we’d be close to running out of fuel, so an early fuel stop was incurred to prevent running out. It was then decided that, as class position wasn’t in jeopardy if we stopped for another splash-and-dash, a 2nd fuel stop was incurred; it being preferable to lose a little time with a longer refuelling stop, than loosing much more time if the bike needed recovering from the far side of the track.\nAll seemed to go well with no accidents or crashes, and despite a fatigued and broken front fairing bracket, the team kept the bike in 12th overall, but more importantly 2nd in the Streetstock class!!! What a result as we brought home some silverware!!! The first ever Pink Triangle Racing endurance Podium!!! WHAT A RESULT on a KTM RC125!!! Thanks to the riders on the team: Jake for jumping on a totally new bike to him and proving he could ride, Tommy for some stunning lap times and posting the team’s fastest lap of 1:19.7 and Adrian for consistent 1:25s to keep the team progressing well.\nA total shame that Rowrah’s had to be called off, but it gives us some more time to prepare the bike for Pembrey (the Bristolian team’s “home” track). Thanks to all the organisers and the whole paddock for being a great crowd….\nOh, also… amazing to see a new KTM RC125 in the mix… Do drop us a message… it’ll be great to discuss tactics to keep these GXSRs at bay!!!\n","date":null,"permalink":"/race_reports/2024/freetech_teesside_rnd3/","section":"Race Reports","summary":"","title":"Freetech Round 3 - Teesside"},{"content":" Event Details Date Friday/Saturday 27th/28th September 2024 Venue Pembrey Race Circuit Championship Freetech Endurance Results: 168 Pink Triangle Racing 42nd overall 109 JP Racing 44th overall Well, another great couple of days out on the bikes with a great track and great people, and for me, a stark reminder that motorsport in the UK is nothing without the dedication of the volunteer marshals. With the Plop Enduro round at Mallory park, on the same weekend, being cancelled at the last minute (due to lack of marshals) two more riders (Ricky, returning to Freetech after a bit of a break, and Pete, a first-time FreeTech-er) were brought on board to join the 109 JP Racing KTM with a last-minute race entry only going in on Thursday afternoon.\nFriday Testing #A great Friday test day was had, but with a bit of laziness about not bothering to change to wets on the first session seeing Scott (first-time racer and FreeTech-er) ditch the bike while on slicks just after the chequered flag. This gave us something to do to get some rear-sets swapped over and the bike ready for the rest of the day. Continual rider improvements were made throughout the day, and final gearings constantly being adjusted until we settled at what seemed a good spot.\nSaturday Race Day #Race day first practise, our laziness took hold again, but this time we refrained from sending a rider out on inappropriate tyres and basically sat out the first practise session. Pete and Adrian then went out and set not-too-great times of ~1m38s whilst on slicks on a damp and cold track. Pete improved on this massively with a 1m32.4s qualifying lap placing 109 JP Racing bike at a respectable 20th place on the grid. Lee followed in the second qualifying session and again posted a respectable 1m33.5s lap putting 168 Pink Triangle Racing bike 23rd on the grid.\nThe race start was stunning by Scott (168 Pink Triangle) whereas the 109 bike dropped a good few places to 41st which was recovered back up to 27th by the first rider change. With the riders of both KTMs being very similarly paced, places were swapped between the two teams as rider changes occurred and both teams hovered around 22nd and 23rd. The potential prospect of team orders was discussed (and mainly rejected) as 168 Pink Triangle bike was doing better in the StreetStock championship. Lap 63 and a loose throttle grip brought 109 JP Racing into the pits for a bit of work. Quickly rectified, it was back out on track again, and Ricky (on 109) found himself directly behind Scott (168).\nMinutes later 109 was back into the pit garage, this time with grass all down its side… Had something further gone wrong with the throttle, had something else gone wrong? Before any damage could be assessed, 168 arrived alongside in the pit garage as well, also with grass down its side… Oh Christ, please don’t say the riders have taken each other off!!!\nA mechanically-handy team meant people were naturally split working on the bikes and ~15min later, both were out again but now in 52nd and 56th place. Thankfully both riders were fine and after a quick medical check up were ready to continue with the day. It turns out a solo mistake, on the far right-hander, lead to a low-side crash, with the following bike having nowhere to go but follow into the grass.\nSo… a generally clean race from there, with consistent low 1m30s laps being put in, clean single-re-fuelling strategy being executed for both bikes and a busy bike runner throughout saw 168 Pink Triangle finishing 42nd overall with 109 JP Racing a lap behind in 44th position, having over-taken Ginger Bread Bikers only 5 laps from the end of the race. Not the result that was available to the teams, given the pace of the riders, but then that’s endurance racing for you!!!\nA great time had by all, and a reminder that massive thanks are due to the volunteer marshals for enabling the racing to go ahead!!!\n","date":null,"permalink":"/race_reports/2024/freetech_pembrey/","section":"Race Reports","summary":"","title":"FreeTech Round 5 - Pembrey"},{"content":"After a sucessful 2023 season, a decision was made to take on the challenge of running 2 bikes throughout the 2024 season.

Pink Triangle Racing rejoined the season at Rounds 2 \u0026amp; 3 at Pembrey after missing out on what sounded like a brilliant opener at Darley Moor. Gutted not to make it — especially as none of us have raced there before — but such is life.\nWith the bike prepped and ready (new engine fitted, which had been sat on the bench all last season), we rolled into Pembrey with slightly longer gearing than our last setup. The plan was to shorten it through the Friday test if needed, but the setup felt spot on.\nFriday Test Day and Round 2 #Smooth sailing — no dramas, no mechanical gremlins, and no spills. Henry, in only his second outing with the team and first time at Pembrey, got valuable laps in and continued adapting to race-shift. Lee and Adrian, a little more familiar with the circuit, were still refining lines — especially the ever-tricky Brooklands Hairpin. In the race, Lee started strong from 32nd on the grid and the team brought it up to 30th by the flag. Solid progress! Henry shaved his times down from ~1:50s to 1:42s, Lee found his rhythm with consistent 1:31s and 1:32s, and Adrian was stuck in the 1:35s — still battling Brooklands Haripin.\nSaturday – Round 3 #Early morning track walk chat with some of the juniors proved golden — Adrian dropped 2 seconds straight off the bat in warm-up! Starting P30 again, Lee fired the team up to P24 by the end of stint one. Adrian carried the momentum, pushing the team to P22 — until throttle issues struck. Loads of slack, no full throttle, and a long pit stop followed. Enter: the humble cable tie.\nAn 18-minute lap cost us dearly, dropping us to 42nd. But from there, it was a steady and rewarding climb back. Henry dropped into the 1:39s, Adrian broke into the 1:31s, and Lee hit a 1:29. We finished 28th overall, 10th in class — another two-place gain on our start.\nHad it not been for the throttle issue (costing roughly 10 laps), we’d have likely finished around 22nd overall and possible 6th in class. But reliability’s part of the game, and it’s on the fix-it list. Most importantly — no crashes, no repairs, just solid racing, and a lot of laughs. Bring on the next round.
